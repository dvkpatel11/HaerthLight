      "prose": "Another splendid turn of the year finds you, Dharti, not merely a year older, but a little more resplendent, a little more utterly *you*. It’s a joy, truly, to witness the quiet unfolding of your particular brand of magic, season after season, each chapter adding another nuanced layer to the beautiful story you’re so thoughtfully crafting.\n\nThere’s a certain mischievous glint in your eye, a wonderfully 'raccoonish' spark that, over the years, has always heralded some clever observation or a perfectly timed, playful jab. It’s a delightful quality, that sassy spirit of yours, a true signature. It means you approach the world not with blind acceptance, but with a discerning wit and a sparkling sense of inquiry that is entirely captivating.\n\nAnd yet, for all your spirited sharpness and the quick, brilliant way you see through pretense, there flows beneath it all a current of such genuine kindness. It’s the gentle hand you offer, the listening ear, the way you champion others with an unwavering loyalty. This beautiful duality, this blend of spirited defiance and profound empathy, is what makes you such a rare and treasured soul.\n\nYou possess that beautiful equilibrium, Dharti, of knowing when to challenge and when to comfort, when to stir the pot and when to offer a soothing balm. It's a dance you perform with such unhurried grace, and it’s a privilege to be on the receiving end of that particular choreography. You don't just exist; you illuminate, adding vibrant colour to the mundane.\n\nSo, as you step into this next year, may it be one of exhilarating discoveries and quiet contentment, where every door opens to reveal something entirely wonderful and utterly *you*. May your 'raccoonish' curiosity lead you down delightfully unexpected paths, and may your abundant kindness continue to be a guiding star for those who seek solace and understanding, while your glorious sass keeps the world wonderfully on its toes. May you gather moments of pure, unadulterated joy that shimmer with the singular light you cast upon everything.",

It’s your birthday, and I find myself smiling, remembering how you’ve always possessed that particular, almost raccoonish knack for finding the quickest, most delightful path through life’s little thickets – be it a genius food hack that transforms dinner, a new health discovery that actually sticks, or a remarkably insightful 'love hack' that cuts straight to the heart of things. It’s a joy to watch your innate curiosity bloom, always seeking, always finding, always with that playful glint in your eye and a funny observation just waiting to surface.\n\nNow, as this chapter unfolds, bringing with it the more robust, sometimes bewildering skirmishes of adulthood, I watch with tender admiration as you approach each new challenge not as a heavy burden, but with a curious, playful tilt of the head. You have a way of transforming even the most daunting quests into a kind of grand, funny adventure, an intricate puzzle you’re determined to solve with a laugh and an ingenious shortcut no one else would ever consider. It’s a testament to your spirit that even when the path seems to narrow, your steps remain light, your perspective bright, always ready to stand up to whatever comes next with remarkable grace and an unyielding sense of fun.\n\nThat effortless, buoyant spirit of yours is such a gift. You are, in so many ways, my joyful reminder of how life can be approached with ingenuity and mirth, a quiet constant in my world. Your latest discovery, your newest hack, your unexpected joke – these are the threads that weave our days together, stitching warmth and laughter into the everyday. There’s a certain comfort in knowing that wherever life takes us, you’ll always be finding the cleverest angle, the most unexpected joy.\n\nMay this next year grant you a clear, joyful path to stand tall amidst these new landscapes, wielding your unique blend of humor, curiosity, and that boundless, playful spirit as your truest compass. May you continue to unearth the hidden delights and clever solutions in every corner, forever transforming the serious into something wonderfully light and full of laughter, just as you do for everyone around you.",

There’s a quiet strength about you these days, Chomi, a calm fire that even the recent storms couldn't quite quench. I see it in the way you carry yourself, moving with a renewed purpose, ready to anchor yourself into this new professional landscape. This job feels less like a step and more like a significant mark drawn in the sand, a testament to keeping your head up through the chaos, even when the ground beneath you felt precarious.\n\nI find myself thinking back to those early mornings, the two of us practically falling onto that bus for our first ridiculous part-time gig, our pockets light but our heads full of dementedly-hilarious schemes and tech-nerd dreams. Even then, the reckless energy and kind heart that define you were evident, though perhaps a little rougher around the edges. To see you now, charting such professional strides, truly cementing your place in this sprawling, modern city, fills me with a pride that feels almost familial. You’ve always had this knack for turning even the most complex problems into a playful challenge, and watching you apply that to the canvas of your life now is nothing short of inspiring.\n\nThere’s a bittersweet hum to it, of course, as there always is when someone you consider a brother moves into a new chapter, but mostly there's just a tender admiration for the man you are becoming. This phase of quiet reflection seems to suit you, softening the edges of that playful spirit just enough to reveal a deeper resilience. You’re navigating these shifting currents with grace, proving once again that beneath the laughter and the energetic pursuit of what’s next, there’s an immovable core of integrity.\n\nSo, as you step onto this new shore, Chomi, may the promising golden hour light of this moment stretch long and bright for you. May the challenges ahead be met with that characteristic blend of wit and unwavering resolve that is uniquely yours. And may this journey be marked by profound growth and an ever-deepening sense of self, a future as wide and expansive as the sea, grounded firmly in the remarkable man you already are.",

This directory holds static visual assets used by Hearthlight.

Expected files:

- Backgrounds (one per theme):
  - `assets/backgrounds/golden-warmth.webp`
  - `assets/backgrounds/midnight-bloom.webp`
  - `assets/backgrounds/ocean-calm.webp`
  - `assets/backgrounds/forest-dawn.webp`
  - `assets/backgrounds/celestial.webp`

- Shared textures:
  - `assets/textures/parchment.webp`
  - `assets/textures/mist.webp`
  - `assets/textures/light-rays.webp`

- Lottie overlays:
  - `assets/lottie/mist-drift.json`

These can be exported from tools like Leonardo AI, Bing Image Creator, or Playground AI.
Keep background files reasonably small (ideally under ~350KB) and free of people, text, and watermarks.
